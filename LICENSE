                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where we want to "prevent lock-in"--for example,
with cell phones, digital music players, and cars.  We hope this license
will help computer users, authors, and others to maximize the freedoms
associated with free software and GNU/Linux systems, regardless of
whether they are used with "standard" PCs or with other devices.

separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the
original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that
Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to
Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the
copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means
any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly
  display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
  Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
  License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
  in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
  sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
  applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
  are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
  combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
  Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
  against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
  lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
  the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
  any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
  shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
  or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet
  the following conditions:

  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works
  a copy of this License; and

  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
  that You changed the files; and

  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
  distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
  from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
  such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
  part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
  within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works;
  within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the
  Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
  Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
  contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
  not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
  within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum
  to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
  attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
  provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
  reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
  Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
  distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
  in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
  You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
  License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the
  above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
  separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
  such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
  to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides
  its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
  OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
  any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
  or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
  determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and
  assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
  License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
  required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
  acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
  damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
  consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
  License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
  not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
  failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
  losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
  such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
  fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
  obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
  accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
  Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
  only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
  harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
  Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
  liability.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
  attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
  the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
  like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
  appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
  program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
  use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.
